# CSGO Deathmatch (DM) mode

## Info
This does not change the standard Deathmatch mode, but only complements it and removes unnecessary functional.

## Functional 
- WeaponMenu (Integrated with the standard purchase menu)
    - AWP limit in %


## Use
- -game_mode 2 -game_type 1
- config (I'll post it soon)

## Thanks
